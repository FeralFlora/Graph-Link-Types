# GraphLinkTypes for Obsidian

## Summary
GraphLinkTypes is a plugin for Obsidian.md that enhances the graph-view by rendering link types dynamically. This plugin leverages the Dataview API and PIXI.js to create a more informative and interactive graph experience. By displaying the types of links between notes, it provides a clearer understanding of the relationships within your Obsidian vault.

## Features
- Dynamically rendered link types in Obsidian's graph view.
- Custom text display for each link based on metadata.
- Efficient updating and rendering using PIXI.js.
